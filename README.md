Fair Warning: I don't know what I'm doing yet, and this isn't ready for prime time. 


Bootstrap with APIs and custom libraries to make my life easier. 

It seems pretty common in my life that I would like an environment that is built quickly, and can do decent looking things. This is my environment that will help. It's a bootstrap instance with various other PHP APIs and some custom javascript and CSS.

Basically, I wanted a jumpstart into a working environment. A lot (most?) of these libraries are actually available via CDN, but sometimes you have to put a web environment in a location where that doesn't work out, so they're being included here as well. 

About the Libraries
-------------------

Right now, the following libraries are installed and included by default, in the index.php file:

Twitter Bootstrap 
<http://getbootstrap.com/>

Google API
<https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/> 

Manage your Google keys via the Cloud Console: 
<https://cloud.google.com/console>
